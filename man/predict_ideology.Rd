\usage{
predict_ideology(tweets, model = "LSTM", embeddings = "w2v",
  embedding_dim = 25, filter_political_tweets = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tweets}{Character vector of Tweets.}

\item{model}{Neural network architecture to use. Options are "LSTM", "BiLSTM", or "C-BiLSTM".}

\item{embeddings}{Type of word embedding algorithm to use. Options are "w2v" (word2vec), "glove", or "random" (random initialization).}

\item{embedding_dim}{Length of word embeddings to use. Options are 25, 50, 100, or 200.}

\item{filter_political_tweets}{If Tweet collection may contain non-political Tweets, optionally filter them out before ideological scaling.}
}
\value{
Vector of float values between 0 and 1, where values closer to 0 indiciate liberal ideological slant, values closer to 1 indicate conservative ideological slant, and values near 0.5 indicate a lack of ideological leaning.
}
